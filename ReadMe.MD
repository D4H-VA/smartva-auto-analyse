#SmartVA Auto-Analyse

**Smart VA Auto-Analyse (‘Auto-Analyse’)** is a diagnostic program built to assist physicians certifying COD for a decedent, by producing near-real-time COD estimates from the Tariff score, and offering the physician up to three potential causes of death (including the likelihood of dying from each cause, rated as: possible, somewhat likely, likely, very likely). 

Auto-Analyse also produces a summary of all endorsed symptoms, providing greater insight for the physician to make an informed, final decision on the COD for each decedent, all on a single computer/device.

This tool was was originally put together by Bryan Richards on behalf of Melbourne University for the Bloomberg Data4Health Initiative.
